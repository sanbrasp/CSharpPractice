I decided to split the practice lessons up into two parts:  
Traditional (class, main) and  
Top-Level Statements

To start with I will be focusing on learning traditional, and I am aware that something isn't working  
in Program.cs of "top_level_statements" project - I will get to that.

~~I realize I will need most practice figuring out traditional, which is why I decided to focus on that first.~~
It appears I might have fixed this now.
