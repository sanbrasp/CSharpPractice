# Project Collection Info

This is a solution with two projects for my personal C# practice.

---

The naming of the projjects was done before I knew about the naming convention, and I don't want 
the headache of changing them - so, they will be named like Python projects forever and ever
(unless I come across an easy, painless way to change them to the correct naming convention)

---

## top_level_statements
Was meant to contain practice tasks using top level statements. However I am not sure I will ever be 
working much in that project as I see more value in learning the traditional way instead.

---

## traditional_no_top_level
This is the project where I am actually doing work. I am adding notes and practice tasks.  
Updates as I go.

The README in this project covers several subjects that have been useful during learning.
