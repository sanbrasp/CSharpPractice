# Project Collection Info

This is a solution with two projects for my personal C# practice.

---

The naming of the projects was done before I knew about the naming convention, and I don't want 
the headache of changing them - so, they will be named like Python projects forever and ever
(unless I come across an easy, painless way to change them to the correct naming convention)

---

## top_level_statements
Will probably not do much work in this project for now...

---

## traditional_no_top_level
This is the project where I am actually doing work. I am adding notes and practice tasks.  
Updates as I go.

The README in this project covers several subjects that have been useful during learning.

---

I also intended to use mirror-push from Gitlab to Github for this project
but unfortunately I couldn't get it to work, so I will try to remember to push 
changes to both individual repos (bad, bad)
