Practice lessons not using top-level statements but the traditional way.

## ITask and MenuService
Implemented mini-framework (ITask, MenuService) and rewritten to fit from another project.  
It auto-discovers tasks if they follow the correct template and adds them to a menu when  
the program runs.  
[ITask](Menu/ITask.cs)  
[MenuService](Menu/MenuService.cs)
